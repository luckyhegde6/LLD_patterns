# Payment System 💰  
(Explained Like I’m 5)

You want to buy a toy.

First, you say:
“I want to buy this.”

Then:
- Card → machine takes money
- UPI → phone asks you to say yes

You wait.

Later, a message says:
“Money taken” or “Money failed”

That message decides the final result.

We never take money twice.
